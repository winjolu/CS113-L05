## HW #5 for CS113 - Stack + Queue Implementation, Solving Palindrome using Stacks

**A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.** One way to programmatically detect palindromes is through iteration (loops), where you check that each character on both ends matches and repeat until the entire string is processed.  A similar approach can be done recursively.

Another approach to checking for palindromes would be to store the characters of the string being checked in a stack and then remove half of the characters, pushing them onto a second stack. When you are finished, if the two stacks are equal, then the string is a palindrome. This works fine if the string has an even number of characters. If the string has an odd number of characters, an additional character should be removed from the original stack before the two stacks are compared. It doesn’t matter what this character is because it doesn’t have to be matched. **Design, code, and test a program that implements this approach.**

You are provided with a `StackInterface` to **implement your stack, make sure to implement the data structure using `java.util.ArrayList`** and naming your implementation `ArrayListStack` (make sure to use generics like you have been for the data structures so far).  The provided `StackTester` assumes you name your implementation that way.  Note that you have also been provided a `PalindromeTester` with the specific `isPalindrome()` method you are required to implement, following the approach above.  The method should take whitespace, case-sensitivity, digits, and symbols into account (see documentation above method).

Make sure to **provide a sequence diagram** for `isPalindrome()`, it should include more details than just the steps outlined above.  Add the image (PNG, JPEG, etc.) in markdown in the space below:

Additionally, **provide your implementation for a `CircularArrayQueue<E>` based on the `java.util.Queue` interface**, passing the JUnit tests provided for the following six methods.

`Queue` interface [methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html) to implement:

| return type | method + description |
|--|--|
| `boolean` | `add(E e)` |
| | Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning true upon success and throwing an IllegalStateException if no space is currently available. |
| `E` | `element()` |
| | Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue. |
| `boolean` | `offer(E e)` |
| | Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions. |
| `E` | `peek()` |
| | Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty. |
| `E` | `poll()` |
| | Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty. |
| `E` | `remove()` |
| | Retrieves and removes the head of this queue. |

Methods inherited from [interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html) `java.util.Collection`:

`addAll`, `clear`, `contains`, `containsAll`, `equals`, `hashCode`, `isEmpty`, `iterator`, `remove`, `removeAll`, `retainAll`, `size`, `toArray`, `toArray`

### Make sure to commit + push *before* the deadline to have your code be considered for grading.
>Pro-Tips:
>- Read the tests thoroughly, note the situations they are testing, and devise a strategy on how to solve the palindrome checker.  Then create the sequence diagram, ensuring your logic is sound.  Finally, implement in code.
>- Make sure to do the book reading, there's lots of code in there to help you along!
